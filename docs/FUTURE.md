# Future Advancements

## Areas Actively being Developed

As a developer, I am focusing my efforts on the pressing next-step updates.

 - **svs~Fetching goes BRRRRR**: Develop an easy-to-use, asynchronous alternative instead of fetching data sequentially
 - **svs~Latest Entries**: Tackle scability of the original SVS specification
 - **svs~SharedSync**: Provide another type of sync that caches other people's data

## Areas to Support as a Contributor

First off, thank you for looking into how you can help support this project. ndn-sync from the start is made to be a comprehensive project covering all "Sync" protocols including future ones. However, contributors (like YOU) are necessary in order to complete that goal. To assist in development, I have included areas which I believe would be best for you to help out in. Nevertheless, all contributions are welcomed and will receive the same support and acceptance.

 - **svs~Feedback on High-level vs Low-level**: How can I make SVS more accessible or easier to use? Can it provide all the nick-pick functionality you desire? I would love your feedback on how the API could be improved for both beginners and experts.
 - **psync~Starting Foundation**: It is wonderful that we have SVS working, but why stop at 1 sync implementation? This would include developing a Bloom Filter / IBLT (IBF) which could be out-sourced.
