# Future Advancements

## Areas Actively being Developed

As a developer, I am focusing my efforts on the pressing next-step updates.

## Areas to Support as a Contributor

First off, thank you for looking into how you can help support this project. ***ndn-sync*** from the start is made to be a comprehensive project covering all "Sync" protocols including future ones. However, contributors (like YOU) are necessary in order to complete that goal. To assist in development, I have included areas which I believe would be best for you to help out in. Nevertheless, all contributions are welcomed and will receive the same support and acceptance.

- **svs~Feedback on High-level vs Low-level**: How can I make SVS more accessible or easier to use? Can it provide all the nick-pick functionality you desire? I would love your feedback on how the API could be improved for both beginners and experts.
- **svs~Go Code Review**: I would not consider myself an expert gopher, as such there might be more performant or more go-like ways to accomplish the task. Either way, I welcome any spotlight.
- **svs~PubSub**: While I work on making the base SVS sync more stable, it would be good to build on PubSub!
